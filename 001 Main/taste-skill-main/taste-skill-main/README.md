A collection of skills that improve how AI tools write frontend code. Instead of generating generic, boring interfaces, the AI builds modern, premium designs with proper animations, spacing, and visual quality.

```

## Skills

Each skill has a different job. You do not need to use all of them at once.

Frontend implementation skills live in `skills/`.
`images-taste-skill` remains part of the normal `skills/` set.
A separate image-only companion also exists at `imagegenskills/frontendwebsiteimageskill/` for the dedicated image-generation-first workflow.

| Skill | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **taste-skill** | The default all-rounder. Use this when you want premium frontend output without forcing one narrow visual style. |
| **gpt-taste** | The stricter, more opinionated variant for GPT/Codex models. Best for high-variance layouts, stronger GSAP direction, and more aggressive anti-slop rules. |
| **images-taste-skill** | The regular image-first frontend reference skill in `skills/images-taste-skill/`. It is optimized for generating premium website images first, deeply analyzing them, then implementing the frontend to match closely. |
| **redesign-skill** | Use this when a project already exists and needs to be improved. It focuses on auditing the current UI first, then fixing weak layout, spacing, hierarchy, and styling decisions. |
| **soft-skill** | Use this for polished, calm, expensive-looking interfaces with softer contrast, more whitespace, premium fonts, and smooth spring motion. |
| **output-skill** | Use this when the model keeps being lazy. It pushes for complete output, no placeholder comments, and no skipped implementation steps. |
| **minimalist-skill** | Use this for cleaner editorial product UI inspired by tools like Notion or Linear. It keeps the palette restrained and the structure crisp. |
| **brutalist-skill** | ⚠️ `BETA` Use this for harder, more mechanical visual language: Swiss typography, sharp contrast, raw structure, and more experimental composition. |
| **stitch-skill** | Use this when you want Google Stitch-compatible semantic design rules, including the extra `DESIGN.md` export format. |

### Which one should I use?

- Start with **taste-skill** if you want the safest general recommendation.
- Use **gpt-taste** if you're using GPT/Codex models, you want a stronger visual opinion, more layout variance, and stricter motion/layout enforcement.
- Use **images-taste-skill** if visual quality is the main challenge and you want the normal image-first workflow: generate the design, inspect it deeply, then code it faithfully.
- Use **redesign-skill** if the project already exists and you want to improve what is there instead of starting from scratch.
- Use **soft-skill**, **minimalist-skill**, or **brutalist-skill** when you already know the visual direction you want.
- Add **output-skill** when your agent tends to leave work unfinished.
- Use **stitch-skill** when you specifically need Stitch-oriented output.

### Image-First Tip

For **images-taste-skill**, it often helps to state the workflow explicitly in the prompt. A line like `follow rules strictly and generate images, then analyze, then code` can reinforce the intended execution order in agents that support both image generation and implementation.

## Settings (taste-skill only)

The taste skill has three settings at the top of the file. Change these numbers (1-10) depending on what you're building:

- **DESIGN_VARIANCE** — How experimental the layout is. (1-3: Clean/centered | 8-10: Asymmetric/modern)
- **MOTION_INTENSITY** — How much animation there is. (1-3: Simple hover | 8-10: Magnetic/scroll-triggered)
- **VISUAL_DENSITY** — How much content fits on one screen. (1-3: Spacious/luxury | 8-10: Dense dashboards)

## Common Questions

**How is this different from other AI design skills?**
Taste Skill includes 9 specialized variants instead of a single file, a 3-dial parameterization system for adjustable output, and anti-repetition rules backed by original research. It is framework-agnostic and works across all major agents.

**Does it work with React, Vue, Svelte, etc.?**
Yes. Taste Skill is framework-agnostic. The rules focus on design decisions, not framework-specific code patterns.

**What is a SKILL.md file?**
A portable instruction file that AI coding agents detect and follow automatically. No configuration is needed, just install it and your agent reads it.
